                    <p>Ajay Che, aka Lifeline, isn’t someone you would expect to find in the Apex Games. The child of wealthy war profiteers, she left home when she learned of the damage her family had caused and enlisted in the Frontier Corps, a humanitarian organization that aids Frontier communities in need. She’s since devoted her life to helping others and joined the Apex Games to give more funds to those in need. Since no one in the Games is innocent — they all know what they signed up for — and every one of her victories means help for those in need, Lifeline has no problem engaging in the popular bloodsport. Or so she tells herself. She may seem sarcastic and callous, but deep down she wants to help people and make the world a better place. If that means taking a few people down in the process, so be it. But when a rift in reality swallows her loyal health drone, D.O.C., Lifeline reaches into it, sacrificing her own hand and barely managing to pull D.O.C. back to reality. Instead of crumpling under the weight of the universe, Lifeline “repairs” her damaged hand with cybernetic implants, then rebuilds D.O.C. better than ever. Now, Lifeline’s days of getting pulled into chaotic events are over. She’ll throw herself into them headfirst, on her–and D.O.C.’s–own terms.</p>
