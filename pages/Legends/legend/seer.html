                <em>“If they stare, give them something to see.”</em>
                <h3>Ambush Artist</h3>
                <div id="textContent" class="text-content collapsed">
                    <p>Before his birth, it was foretold that Seer would bring pain and suffering to the world--and the night he was born, a meteor barreled across the sky and struck his world’s moon. It was considered a bad omen, and when the pale blue eyes of Obi Edolasim opened, his community saw a cursed child. His parents did not; they loved him unconditionally because they saw the true empathic, creative soul of their son. They even supported him when he was drawn to the theatricality of the Arenas, where he could express himself fully. At first, the crowds felt unsure of him. But over time, with each victory, the power inside him grew, and with it, his strength in the Arena. And as his reputation began to precede him, a strange thing happened… The people in the crowd who were downtrodden, outcast, and forgotten—they saw themselves in Seer. Soon, throngs of people would come out just to see him fight—cheering Seer on as their champion. This legend from the Arenas made his way to the Apex Games as an icon of the shunned, the unaccepted, and the unabashedly original. Still, there are those that continue to blame him for the deterioration of the moon of his homeworld Boreas for many reasons–his curse, his underwhelming aid to the people of Boreas, and now for bringing the Games to the moon. He fights on to make things right, however he can.</p>
