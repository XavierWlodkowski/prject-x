                <h3>Translocating Thief</h3>
                <div id="textContent" class="text-content collapsed">
                    <p>When Loba was nine, she looked on as simulacrum hitman Revenant killed her family. Left with nothing, Loba survived by picking pockets. As her skills improved, Loba used every tool at her disposal to lift herself from the gutter. Everything changed when she broke into a supposedly impenetrable facility and got her hands on the Jump Drive tech stored inside. With her new teleportation bracelet, the most secure and unattainable items were within her reach. So was her dream of living the high life. Rumors spread across the Outlands: if you wanted something valuable -and well guarded- Loba’s who you go to. She was almost able to put her past behind her. But when Revenant joined the Games, her past catapulted into her future. Desperate to find a way to kill him, she sabotaged a facility full of Revenant bodies, bringing Skull Town and Thunderdome crashing down in the process. However, she learned it was just one of many such factories hidden across the Frontier. After finding out Revenant wishes for death, she’s made it her mission to keep him alive as revenge. She plays in the Games to keep getting vengeance on Revenant, but.it doesn’t hurt that the arenas are brimming with treasures just waiting to be plucked.</p>
