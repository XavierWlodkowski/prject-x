                    <p>When Alter emerged from her dimension into another (with her past held close to the chest), she had only two things: her interdimensional traveling Void tech, and a desire to have fun. She stole the fanciest of foods, learned to fight through dicey situations, and took on odd jobs for personal favors–though she didn’t have a problem double-crossing her clients if it was more beneficial or amusing. Never needing to stick around for the consequences of her actions eroded any sense of morality or responsibility she had. She could focus on what was important: making sure life was never mundane. Alter was drawn to worlds on the edge of complete destruction. Whether something devastating was already happening or she helped usher in the apocalypse herself, she was there to watch whatever catastrophe ensued. It was only in those moments, after all, that people took off the masks they always wore and she could see their true selves. Finding these world-ending events was a toss up. Sometimes she’d find what she was looking for, and on others, she’d have missed the main event in worlds already ruined. But in some of these ruined worlds, Alter began to notice an interesting commonality… Many of these worlds hadn’t met their end by some random event; they had been destroyed by the same person.</p>
